## GitHub Image Upload Hack

By [Aashish Kumar](https://github.com/aashish-ak)

Did you know that you can use GitHub to host any of your images?? Although you can also use sites like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload), to upload images and host them. But that's too mainstream :stuck_out_tongue:. You can use Github for this too. You just need to have a Github account for this. Follow these steps:

- Open any repository on GitHub (not the forked ones, they do not have the issues tab).
- Open a new issue.
- Just drag your image in the text box.
- The image will automatically upload and the image link will appear.
- Copy it and use it anywhere :fire:.
