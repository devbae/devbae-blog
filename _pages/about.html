<h2> Building a Community </h2>

<p>
  We're aiming to build an open source community in which everyone can contribute and share good resources for learning. Anyone can be a part of our community by joining our <a href="https://github.com/devbae">organisation on Github</a> and contributing to our projects by writing tech blogs, short tutorials and sharing useful resources. Fork our <a href="https://github.com/devbae/devbae-blog">blog repo</a> and start contributing.
</p>

<h2> Future Work </h2>

<p>
  Currently we're having a Jekyll blog and we're aiming to build a proper website for this, so that we can have many
  features and pages like <strong>Frequently Occuring Errors(FOE)</strong> etc. We'll be migrating as soon as we have sufficient number of people ready to join the project.
